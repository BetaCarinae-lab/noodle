# NOODLE
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v1.3.0-blue)

**Noodle** is a project of mine, It is a language in js using ohm-js, It's syntax is inspired by rust and javascript

## INSTALLATION
To install this language, download any release **except 0.9.7**, which has severe security flaws  
Then unzip into any directory and run these commands:
```bash
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```
you should now be able to run `noodle --help` or any other command
