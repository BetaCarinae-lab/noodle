Noodle is a high level programming language built using TS, PKG, and OhmJS.

Check out the wiki for help and syntax!

## INSTALLATION
To install this language, download any release **except 0.9.7**, which has severe security flaws  
Then unzip into any directory and run these commands:
```bash
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh

you should now be able to run `noodle --help` or any other command
