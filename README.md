# NOODLE

**Noodle** is a project of mine, It is a language in js using ohm-js, It's syntax is inspired by rust and javascript

## Warning

This language is **not** intended for production use.  
Noodle is a *hobby and experimental project*, and its features, behavior, and stability are subject to change at any time.

## INSTALLATION
To install this language, download any release **except 0.9.7**, which has severe security flaws  
Then unzip into any directory and run these commands:
```bash
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```
you should now be able to run `noodle --help` or any other command

## Roadmap

- Define core language concepts  
- Prototype language semantics in JavaScript  
- Implement basic language features *(current stage)*  
- Continue iterative development and feature expansion  

## Contributing

At this time, the project is maintained solely by me. Contributions are not currently being accepted, as this project is intended for personal learning and so i have at  
least something on my portfolio.
