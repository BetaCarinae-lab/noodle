# NOODLE

Noodle is a project in the works. 
It is a language that i am designing to be quick, yet low level.  
Its syntax will be similar to both rust and js

### Warning 
Do not use this language for any serious project.  
It is a *hobby* project

## Roadmap
Creation  
   |  
Prototype Semantics in JS
   |  
Build up basic functions <= (WE ARE HERE)   
   |  
Add Rust for low level support like references  
   |  
Continue updating and adding new things  

## Contribution
Right now, I am solo on this project and do not need anyone to contribute (as this is a hobby project)
