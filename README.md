# NOODLE

**Noodle** is an experimental programming language currently under development. The goal of the project is to explore a language design that is performant and easy to set up anywhere, while maintaining a concise and expressive syntax. Its syntax is inspired by elements of **Rust** and **JavaScript**. Which it is written in

## Warning

This language is **not** intended for production use.  
Noodle is a *hobby and experimental project*, and its features, behavior, and stability are subject to change at any time.

## INSTALLATION
To install this language, download any release with these prerequisites:
Node v18 or higher,
Then unzip into any directory and run these commands:
```bash
npm install
sudo npm link

## Roadmap

- Define core language concepts  
- Prototype language semantics in JavaScript  
- Implement basic language features *(current stage)*  
- Continue iterative development and feature expansion  

## Contributing

At this time, the project is maintained solely by the author. Contributions are not currently being accepted, as this project is intended for personal experimentation and learning.
