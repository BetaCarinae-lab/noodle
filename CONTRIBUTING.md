### Contribution
Ok, To be honest here, I have no idea how to contribute to anything.  
your best bet is to look online for some tutorials, but!  
#### Here is what you need to know:  
When you fork the repo use
`npm install` to install the dependencies
and create 2 folders, `js` and `zipped`

Since I had a bad experience with `npm run` once, We, er I use  
manual `.sh` files for all my tasks,  
`sudo ./build.sh` -> Builds noodle, uninstalls the current one, and installs the newly built one  
`./install/./uninstall .sh` -> Pretty self explanatory  
`./package.sh` -> Packages noodle into zip files, ready for distribution  

Once done, submit your PR and i'll review soon as I can :)
